**how it works**

The program prompts the user to enter the speed of the car.
It calculates the demerit points based on the difference between the entered speed and the speed limit (70 km/h).
For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, 1 demerit point is assigned.
If the speed is within the limit, the program outputs "Ok".
If there are demerit points, the program displays the number of points.
If the demerit points exceed 12, it indicates that the driver's license is suspended
